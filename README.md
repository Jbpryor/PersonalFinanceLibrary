# PersonalFinanceLibrary

This is a personal finance application I created to mimick a whiteboard I've been using for many years. It lets me know how much "spend on whatever" money I have after each paycheck and also a way to track groceries and gas for my car. It pulls in data from an excel file that tracks all of my bills. The excel file is automated from a python script that parses my email account. That's another project though. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me.
